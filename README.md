# Data Analysis of Global Missing Migrants Dataset using SQL

This repository includes SQL queries for analyzing the Global Missing Migrants Dataset from Kaggle.

The following analyses can be performed using the provided scripts:

ðŸ“Œ Calculating descriptive statistics: Use SQL queries to calculate counts, averages, minimum, and maximum values for key variables in the dataset.

ðŸ“Œ Generating summary statistics: Use SQL queries to generate summary statistics for important variables such as the total number of missing migrants, total deaths, or causes of death.

ðŸ“Œ Analyzing the distribution of missing migrants: Utilize SQL queries and grouping techniques to analyze the distribution of missing migrants across different demographic categories.

ðŸ“Œ Investigating migration routes and locations: Use SQL queries to identify migration routes and locations associated with missing migrants. This can help identify high-risk areas or migration paths with a significant number of missing migrants.

ðŸ“Œ Identifying common causes of death: Analyze the dataset to identify the most common causes of death and their distribution across different regions or migration routes.

ðŸ“Œ Investigating correlations between causes of death and demographic factors: Analyze the dataset to investigate any correlations between causes of death and demographic factors.

ðŸ“Œ Trend analysis of missing migrants: Use SQL queries to examine trends over time, such as monthly or yearly variations in missing migrant numbers or deaths.
